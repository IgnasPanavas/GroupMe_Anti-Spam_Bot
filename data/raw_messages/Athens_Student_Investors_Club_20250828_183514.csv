ü§©ü§©,ham
this seems to be working. Good earnings,ham
Robinhood screwed me over with the timing of my money wire I‚Äôm still upset abt it,ham
Did any of all buy in on the bullish ipo,ham
^^^ cuz Berkshire loaded up on it,ham
Btw UNH now does legitimately look like a good bottom bounce play,ham
if that's your thesis then that's fine. I just happen to trade different so I see it different. Best of luck.,ham
"That‚Äôs a good point and i agree don‚Äôt jus buy cuz its low but palo alto is still growing in recurring revenue, recent sell off was an overreaction in my opinion bc people were cautious abt execution risk for their new acquisition.",ham
takes a while to understand what to do imo...,ham
"Yea some YouTubers that are pretty good are carmine rosato, Aristotle and scarface. BlakeStonks on twitter provides good info too.",ham
damn buddy got cooked,ham
consider it tuition,ham
yeah definitely,ham
And only use money youre ready to lose ^,ham
"whatever path you end up taking, I would avoid paper trading. If you're seeing a system that makes sense to you, put some real money behind and accept you're going to make mistakes. Just try not to blow up before you learn what you're doing.",ham
Yeah lots of scams out there promoting discords or trading courses. Robinhood screenshots of returns and portfolio balances aren‚Äôt proof of a good strategy,ham
"youre looking at broken stocks. Unless you have some sort of fundamental thesis I would recommend avoiding. See $UNH for what I mean by broken. It's an extreme example but the premise is something changed about the thesis for it to fall that much. You would only consider buying $UNH here because it's showing the bottom. Don't buy things going down because they are low, they will probably go lower.",ham
You can learn a lot from youtube tiktok but if it looks too good to be true it is,ham
I would say YouTube but read books ngl,ham

TTD has strong upside potential,ham
TSM looks good,ham
Hammer tsm after china takes over Taiwan and it plummets üíÄ,ham

Hey guys I‚Äôm new to the club and wondering when meetings are and if there are any fees,ham
So I was referring more to monetary gains,ham
SPY went up 5 days in a row,ham
"There is always time to find something to pick on about the educational system or life, but for some reason I don‚Äôt think that is what you mean. Always on the reading grind to continue to get better",ham
Good week for everyone?,ham
"Thanks bro, I‚Äôll check out your page",ham
If you use twitter my @ is @always_green_1. I post a bunch of charts of the stuff I trade,ham
What‚Äôs your go to strategy for options and which stocks do you prefer to trade,ham
My strategy was too risky and my technical analysis wasn‚Äôt the best so I ended getting lucky some trades and failing to exit when I should‚Äôve with others,ham
Staying away from 0DTEs would prob be a good start,ham
Fair enough,ham
I‚Äôm gonna hop back in once I feel more confident in my trades again,ham
"Nah, I took a break from trading options so I can fix my strategy and mindset",ham
Do you have more capital now?,ham
And there‚Äôs more time to adjust to the market trends of the week,ham
"Definitely, I used to do weeklies but I would end up buying out of the money since I didn‚Äôt have a lot of capital",ham
Idk weeklies tend to work better long term imo,ham
Sometimes 2-3 is bad on CPI days,ham
"Yea, that‚Äôs honestly the worst time to make a trade",ham
Stay away from 12-1,ham
I had to start waiting till certain time periods where there‚Äôs a lot of price action to not worry as much about the theta and decay,ham
"True, it‚Äôs always risky but the profit is worth it if timed right",ham
I mean 0DTEs will kill you regardless,ham
Lol,ham
I had to learn that the hard way with SPY daily contracts consolidating at lunchtime,ham
"For reference, this picture shows how the stock shrinks into a range and breaks out the range either up or down",ham
Buying a short term option in consolidation will kill you through decay,ham
Yeah it‚Äôs just to understand when to take positions and when to wait,ham
"Oh okay, I didn‚Äôt know the specific name for those two movements",ham
Yes,ham
Would bullish and bearish flags be an example of consolidation while breakouts past that point be expansion,ham
The expand through breakouts or breakdowns,ham
The consolidate and compress price action,ham
Nah it‚Äôs more a general concept about how the markets move,ham
Is that similar to support and resistance,ham
Or compression prob a better word,ham
Understand the idea of expansion and contraction,ham
These two videos worked for me but the first one with Kelly helped me understand it a lot,ham
https://youtu.be/NdsC5VHN8mE?si=-7Lzfa1TnJdU8G1_ https://youtu.be/fIRqNA0nOTc?si=3dx1eSrBSfX-UJX9,ham
Well*,ham
"True, I feel like that probably plays a big part as eell",ham
Then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy,ham
If everyone is looking at the same thing,ham
It usually work though since it‚Äôs based on the average moves during the time frames you look at,ham
Especially at specific points in the day,ham
Everyone has their own perspective on the markets and market has its own patterns in a sense,ham
appreciate it,ham
I got a couple videos I watched; I‚Äôll send them here,ham
"Yeah, easy to see the psychology of other traders and what prices have different buy and sell pressure",ham
But you can‚Äôt tell me when the same place reverses price 5 times in a row it doesn‚Äôt mean something,ham
There are things that work and things that dont,ham
Charting is just visualization of traders moves,ham
spots to learn or just youtube,ham
Charting def works,ham
ICT conceptsüëÅÔ∏è,ham
does charting work typically it seems like pseudoscience,ham
Charting,ham
"That‚Äôs also why I bought arm for the challenge, had it in my watchlist already and did a quick google search to see what it does",ham
I haven‚Äôt been too in tune with the company so I‚Äôm basing it off the current increase for ai,ham
it‚Äôs definitely a great company but it‚Äôs had its recent share of down turns,ham
I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs because of the shift to ai and its strong presence as a processing chip,ham
Definitely and it‚Äôs been doing me good for the market challenge,ham
what makes yall think it‚Äôs going to continue going up,ham
NVDA‚Äôs basically on sale rn,ham
"Dang, 95% return is crazy",ham
Elon musk.,ham
Imo it‚Äôs the most undervalued stock on the market,ham
NVDA is up almost 20 percent this week probably a good time to buy right now it‚Äôs about to reach all time highs,ham
What makes you think they‚Äôre going up soon tho,ham
I have 330 calls,ham
"For any short term traders here, TSLA looks amazing for a move to 240 and potentially 270",ham
Right there with you,ham
I love this company,ham
Holy shit,ham
nvidia up 8% lfg,ham
Lost me with that one,ham
Alright bro,ham
"Ignas, that would ruin the point of the idea. I‚Äôm happy to discuss it later, but if everyone knew‚Ä¶ It wouldn‚Äôt be the tat valuable ‚Ä¶",ham
What companies does that include,ham
"I have a positive investment idea in the entertainment industry. It‚Äôs for people that like to travel. It‚Äôs only going to be at this value for a short amount of time. It is said it can diversify life in manners including: socially, mentally, emotionally, and MAYBE even physically. Willing to spread wealth in the dm. Serious inquires only‚Ä¶.",ham
But if you‚Äôd like to buy some 420 calls for next year I‚Äôd be glad to sell you some,ham
I disagree but no one knows,ham
That‚Äôs bold,ham
I think tesla in the next year will reach a all time high,ham
we should make a poll üòÇ,ham
long term trading is taxed less though,ham
"If the story makes sense or is promising, investors will buy even if the numbers look stretched",ham
And narrative,ham
Short and medium term trading is built on psychology,ham
Because with tsla it‚Äôs never about the valuation,ham
Do you know something that we don‚Äôt??? What are you using for these evaluations? I can never seem to get on the correct side of the Elon coin,ham
You‚Äôre chilling,ham
bought at 196,ham
yea as soon as it‚Äôs up i‚Äôm taking profits,ham
Technically good for 270 imo,ham
I would hold a lil bit longer in this spot,ham
"i needa get rid of tesla, im not a trader",ham
Got 230c for this week and next week,ham
I also got some Tesla 330 calls for January 2025,ham
People not vibing with random discussions ig,ham
I prefer the wider range of flexibility and opportunity from options,ham
Also tax advantages,ham
Which is why less experienced should prob go with futures,ham
True,ham
Implied volatility can also be a killer,ham
That‚Äôs fair,ham
"Mmm okay, bc when you have a price target in futures you know exactly how much money you can make or lose but options you just don‚Äôt know",ham
Yes,ham
Have you traded futures,ham
Compared to futures lol,ham
Futures do not,ham
Options have defined risk,ham
So many aligning factors you can‚Äôt control,ham
Risk not really,ham
But also give you way more risk and uncertainty,ham
If you can afford high quality,ham
Options give more opportunity,ham
Meh,ham
Futures>>>,ham
or crypto,ham
idk anything about bitcoin,ham
Yeah,ham
Stop trading far OTM options lol,ham
I‚Äôm thinking to go all in on bitcoin tbh,ham
Can someone give me some trading advice,ham
gemini might outperform gpt in the future,ham
google took a dip,ham
But November is asking for a lot,ham
Maybe,ham
If you had said like Jan 2025,ham
Meh,ham

Just that there‚Äôs a small fee on the etf,ham
Doesn‚Äôt really matter tbh,ham
