‚ÄúTo address the question about compensation for the internship: We are not paying an hourly fee starting off. However, the ""goals"" they would need to hit to be compensated are not like a typical sales job model. For example, once an intern makes 50 calls or gathers info about a minimum number of advisors, they will be compensated. Additionally, we will pay commission on any Summit registration received, but we will also pay a bonus for certain milestones met.  For example, once an intern gathers certain information from a minimum number of advisors, a bonus will be paid.  So there are actually two ways to be compensated.‚Äù",regular

"Good evening everyone! Above I have attached a link to an internship opportunity from BlueVault, which is a national alternative investments services firm. Deadline to apply is November 1st. Here‚Äôs what Caroline from BlueVault sent me regarding compensation in this role: 

‚ÄúTo address the question about compensation for the internship: We are not paying an hourly fee starting off. However, the ""goals"" they would need to hit to be compensated are not like a typical sales job model. For example, once an intern makes 50 calls or gathers info about a minimum number of advisors, they will be compensated. Additionally, we will pay commission on any Summit registration received, but we will also pay a bonus for certain milestones met.  For example, once an intern gathers certain information from a minimum number of advisors, a bonus will be paid.  So there are actually two ways to be compensated.‚Äù",regular
